## Updates

- On your Mac go to:
  ** > System Preferences > Software Update** check for and install any updates that are available.

## Security Settings

- Go to: ** > System Preferences > Security & Privacy**
  - **> General:** Ensure that a login password has been set. Set your preferences for how long until a password is required and set a lock message if desired.
  - **> FileVault:** Recommended to turn on FileVault
  - **> Privacy:** Will need to give permissions to programs as you install them, it will be done from here

## System Preferences

Check preferences for settings that you want, some of the recommended ones I use.

- Go to ** > System Preferences**

  - **> General:** Uncheck **Ask to keep changes..**
  - **> General:** Check **Allow Handoff..** to enable copy/pasting to and from other Apple devices as well as messaging and calls on your Mac
  - **> Dock:** Change the size and position to what you like
  - **> Accessibility > Siri:** Enable type to Siri so you can use Siri without talking at your Mac
  - **> Touch ID:** Setup Touch ID if available on your Mac
  - **> Users & Groups > Login Options:** Click the lock icon and enter your password to edit. Setup automatic login if you are the only user, click **Show fast user switching menu** to enable your name in the menu bar of your Mac. Looks good and offers a quick way to logoff and change user accounts.
  - **> Keyboard > Keyboard:** Set **Key Repeat** to fast and **Delay Until Repeat** to short. If you are using an external keyboard make sure **Use F1, F2, etc..** is selected so that you can use your keyboard function keys
  - **> Trackpad > Point & Click:** Tracking Speed to fast
  - **> Trackpad > More Gestures:** Select all options for easy navigation
  - **> Mouse:** Tracking Speed to fast
