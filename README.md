## Updates

- On your Mac go to:
  ** > System Preferences > Software Update** check for and install any updates that are available.

## Security Settings

- Go to: ** > System Preferences > Security & Privacy**
  - **> General:** Ensure that a login password has been set. Set your preferences for how long until a password is required and set a lock message if desired.
  - **> FileVault:** Recommended to turn on FileVault
  - **> Privacy:** Will need to give permissions to programs as you install them, it will be done from here

## System Preferences

Check preferences for settings that you want, some of the recommended ones I use.

- Go to ** > System Preferences**

  - **> General:** Uncheck **Ask to keep changes..**
  - **> General:** Check **Allow Handoff..** to enable copy/pasting to and from other Apple devices as well as messaging and calls on your Mac
  - **> Dock:** Change the size and position to what you like
  - **> Accessibility > Siri:** Enable type to Siri so you can use Siri without talking at your Mac
  - **> Touch ID:** Setup Touch ID if available on your Mac
  - **> Users & Groups > Login Options:** Click the lock icon and enter your password to edit. Setup automatic login if you are the only user, click **Show fast user switching menu** to enable your name in the menu bar of your Mac. Looks good and offers a quick way to logoff and change user accounts.
  - **> Keyboard > Keyboard:** Set **Key Repeat** to fast and **Delay Until Repeat** to short. If you are using an external keyboard make sure **Use F1, F2, etc..** is selected so that you can use your keyboard function keys
  - **> Trackpad > Point & Click:** Tracking Speed to fast
  - **> Trackpad > More Gestures:** Select all options for easy navigation
  - **> Mouse:** Tracking Speed to fast

## Terminal tools

Customize the terminal to add some flair.

- Install Oh my ZSH
  - Install Oh My Zsh following the instructions [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- Customize the theme
  - Inside your terminal open the `.zshrc` file that edits your Oh My Zsh environment
    - Edit the `.zshrc` file to use the Agnoster theme `ZSH_THEME="agnoster"`
    - While in the `.zshrc` file add the line `DEFAULT_USER=YOURUSERNAME` where `YOURUSERNAME` is the username that shows up in your terminal if you would like to shorten your name path in terminal
  - Need to install the Powerline fonts from [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) for the theme to look proper
    - Once installed go to **Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > Text** and change the Font to one of the powerline compatible fonts, I prefer the Source Code Pro font
  - Change your theme to the solarized dark theme colors
    - In terminal you can add a profile to change the theme to match that of the solarized dark theme. [Here](https://gist.github.com/JonDunlap/9ea50b552b0b9d7c84e969866f59baba) is a gist with my solarized terminal profile, or you can go to the [Solarized website](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) to copy the color palette for either the dark or light theme that you prefer.

Alternativly you can install [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) as your default terminal

- If you have already followed the install instructions for Oh My Zsh the only thing you should have to do is change the font and theme in iTerm to match those in terminal
- If not follow the same install instructions from the previous steps
